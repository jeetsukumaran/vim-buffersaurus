INTRODUCTION~

Buffersaurus is a plugin for searching and indexing the contents of buffers
for regular expression patterns or collections of regular expression patterns.
Results are displayed in separate buffer, and can be (optionally) viewed with
user-specifiable lines of context (i.e., a number of lines before and/or after
the line matching the search pattern) or filtered for specific patterns.

                                                    *buffersaurus-basic-usage*
BASIC USAGE~

The command ":Bsgrep {pattern}" is the most general way of invoking
Buffersaurus. It will search all listed buffers for lines of text matching the
given regular expression pattern. If you want Buffersaurus to search ONLY the
current buffer, then follow the command with a bang operator to restrict the
search scope: ":Bsgrep! {pattern}".

The results are stored in memory (the "catalog"), and a new window (the
"catalog viewer") will open up to display the results. Each matching line will
result in an index entry in the catalog, and by default be displayed in its
own row, grouped by the buffer file in which it occurs. You can choose to list
the lines ungrouped, and sorted by line number, by filepath + line number, or
alphabetically.

All standard Vim movement keys (e.g., "h", "j", "k", "l", <C-F>, <C-B> etc.)
work within the catalog viewer. Moving to an entry (i.e., indexed line) and
typing <CR> (or "o") will open the target buffer in a previous window and go
to the the matching line. Numerous other key maps are available to customize
how the matching line is opened: e.g., a new vertical split ("s"), horizontal
split ("i"), or tab page ("t").  In addition, the target can be opened
"silently" or previewed in the background in the previous window ("go" or
"O"), new "vertical split ("gs" or "S"), new horizontal split ("gi" or "I") or
new tab page ("T").  Special movement keys are available to quickly take you
to the next or previous file group ("f" and "F", respectively). You can also
simultaneously go to the next or previous indexed line and preview it (<SPACE>
and "<C-SPACE>, respectively) without leaving the catalog viewer.

When in the catalog viewer, you can cycle through the sort regimes by typing
"cs", or refresh the catalog (re-index the lines) by pressing "r".

A special feature is the "contexted" mode. You can type "cc" (or "C") to
toggle contexted mode on and off. When contexted mode is off, each indexed
line is displayed by itself on a single row. After you press "cc" to switch on
contexted mode, each indexed line is shown with a number of lines of context
that occur before and after it in the source file. The exact number of lines
is controlled by the "g:buffersaurus_context_size" variable.  By default, this
is set to "[4, 4]", which means to show 4 lines before and 4 lines after the
matched line. You can set this to any pair of values you prefer in your
$VIMRUNTIME. When viewing results in contexted mode, multiple levels of
folding are available, to allow you to fold away context or file groups.

If you want to refine the results further, you can use the command ":Bsfilter
{filter-pattern}" from within the catalog viewer. This will filter out any
indexed lines that do not match "{filter-pattern}". The filter can be switched
off by ":Bsfilter!".

You can close the catalog viewer by pressing "q". The last search results are
retained in memory, and the command ":Bsopen" will open the viewer again to
re-display these; you may want to type "r" to re-run the search if any of your
buffers have changed.

Once you have carried out a search and jumped to a matched line, and/or closed
the catalog viewer, you can jump to the next or previous matching line
directly from a working listed buffer without going back to re-opening the
catalog viewer. You can just use the commands ":Bsnext" or ":Bsprev".  For
convenience, you may want to map some keys to these commands if you find
yourself using them a lot.

SPECIAL SEARCHES~

Buffersaurus provides two other approaches to search beyond the explicitly
single regular expression pattern-based approach described above.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Table-of-Contents" Search~

For some types of files, a "table-of-contents" can be generated using the
command ":Bstoc". This will search all buffers (or just the current buffer if
the bang operator is used: ":Bstoc!") for a set of patterns that define
"important" terms given the file types. For example, if dealing with common
programming language source code files, all class and method/function
definition lines are targeted. The results can be browsed and navigated just
as above. Note that this only works if the filetype is known, and some clearly
defined terms are available for that filetype: Python, C++, C, etc. With
other filetypes, e.g. text, the pattern defaults to any lines with a
non-whitepsace as the first character, which may or may not be useful. In
these, as well as other cases, it makes sense to use the ":Bsterm" command.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Term" Search~

The command ":Bsterm {term-name}" takes a single argument, which should be a
key defined in a dictionary that maps term-names to regular expression
patterns. Executing this command will search all buffers (or just the current
buffer if ":Bsterm! {term-name}" is used) for the regular expression
referenced by the term. In essence, you can consider terms as "pre-defined" or
"saved" search patterns, that can quickly and easily be run when needed .

Buffersaurus comes with some example terms pre-defined, "PyClass"
and "PyDef" (which match Python class and function definitions, respectively):

        "PyClass"     : '^\s*class\s\+[A-Za-z_]\i\+(.*',
        "PyDef"       : '^\s*def\s\+[A-Za-z_]\i\+(.*',

You can add more definitions by providing the dictionary definition in your
$VIMRUNTIME using the variable "g:buffersaurus_element_term_map". These
definitions will extend Buffersaurus' built-in defintions.

COMMANDS~

:Bsg[rep][!] {search-pattern}
                    Search buffer(s) for the regular expression |pattern|
                    given by {search-pattern}. If
                    "g:buffersaurus_default_single_file" is not defined or
                    true, then all buffers will be searched unless the "bang"
                    operator is given, in which case the search will be limitd
                    to the current buffer. Otherwise, if
                    "g:buffersaurus_default_single_file" is defined and true,
                    then only the current buffer will be searched unless the
                    bang operator is given, in which the search will be across
                    all buffers. If "g:buffersaurus_set_search_register" is
                    not false (0), then the pattern will also be assigned to
                    the search register.

:Bstoc[!]
                    Generate a "table of contents" type catalog for buffers,
                    based on the specific filetype of each buffer. If
                    "g:buffersaurus_default_single_file" is not defined or
                    true, then all buffers will be searched unless the "bang"
                    operator is given, in which case the search will be limitd
                    to the current buffer. Otherwise, if
                    "g:buffersaurus_default_single_file" is defined and true,
                    then only the current buffer will be searched unless the
                    bang operator is given, in which the search will be across
                    all buffers. See |buffersaurus-filetype-patterns| for more
                    information on the patterns to be matched.

:Bsterm[!] {term-name}
                    Generate a catalog of occurrences of the term pattern
                    named {term-name} in buffers. If
                    "g:buffersaurus_default_single_file" is not defined or
                    true, then all buffers will be searched unless the "bang"
                    operator is given, in which case the search will be limitd
                    to the current buffer. Otherwise, if
                    "g:buffersaurus_default_single_file" is defined and true,
                    then only the current buffer will be searched unless the
                    bang operator is given, in which the search will be across
                    all buffers. See |buffersaurus-term-patterns| for
                    information on defining and using terms.

:Bso[pen]
                    (Re-)open the most recent catalog.

:Bsn[ext]
                    Go to the next matched line from the most recent catalog
                    (like |:cnext|).

:Bsp[rev]
                    Go to the previous matched line from the most recent
                    catalog (like |:cprev|).

:Bss[tatus][!]
                    Show brief (without "!") or detailed (with "!")
                    description of the most recent catalog.

:Bsf[ilter][!] [filter-pattern]
                    [Only available when inside a Buffergator catalog viewer
                    buffer] Without "!": filter results to only show lines
                    matching the regular expression |pattern|
                    [filter-pattern]. If [filter-pattern] is not given, then
                    the previous filter pattern will be used. If there is no
                    previous filter pattern, then the user will be prompted
                    for a new pattern. With "!": remove filter. In all cases
                    if [filter-pattern] is "*" or ".*", then the saved pattern
                    will be cleared and the filter removed.

KEY MAPPINGS (CATALOG VIEWER)~

Search results are stored a "catalog", and displayed in special buffer
referred to as a "catalog viewer".  The following key mappings are available
in the catalog viewer.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Catalog Management~

cc, C               Toggle contexted view on/off.
cs                  Cycle through sort regimes.
f                   Filter results for lines matching pattern.
F                   Enter and apply a new filter pattern
r                   Rebuild/refresh the index.
<C-G>               Brief status of index/catalog.
g<C-G>              Detailed status of index/catalog.
q                   Quit the index/catalog window.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Movement Within the Catalog Viewer~

<C-N>               Go to the next index entry.
<C-P>               Go to the previous index entry.
]f                  Go to the next file entry.
[f                  Go the previous file entry.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jumping to the Matched Line~

The following keys all open the target buffer and focus to it. The catalog
buffer will be closed if 'g:buffersaurus_autodismiss_on_select' evaluates to
true; otherwise it will be kept open.


o, <CR>             Switch focus to the previous window and go to the
                    currently-selected entry.
s                   Split the previous window vertically, switch focus, and
                    go to the currently-selected entry.
i                   Split the previous window horizotnally, switch focus, and
                    go to the currently-selected entry.
t                   Open the currently-selected entry in a new tab page.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Previewing Results Without Leaving the Catalog Viewer~

The following keys all open the target, but retain focus on the catalog
viewer.

O, go               Preview the currently-selected entry in the previous
                    window.
S, gs               Preview the currently-selected entry in a new vertical
                    split.
I, gi               Preview the currently-selected entry in a new horizontal
                    split.
T                   Preview the currently-selected entry in a new tab page.
<SPACE>             Go to the next entry and show it in the previous window.
<C-SPACE>           Go to the previous entry and show it in the previous
                    window.

OPTIONS AND SETTINGS~

The following options can be used to customize the behavior of this plugin.

g:buffersaurus_viewport_split_policy~
    Default: "B"
    Determines how a new Buffersaurus window will be opened. Can be one of the
    following values:
        "d"   : user-specified Vim default
        "D"   : user-specified Vim default
        "N"   : no split, reuse current buffer
        "n"   : no split, reuse current buffer
        "L"   : vertical left (full screen height)
        "l"   : vertical left (within current window)
        "R"   : vertical right (full screen height)
        "r"   : vertical right (within current window)
        "T"   : horizontal top (full screen width)
        "t"   : horizontal top (within current window)
        "B"   : horizontal bottom (full screen width)
        "b"   : horizontal bottom (within current window)

g:buffersaurus_sort_regime~
    Default: "fl"
    Sets the default sort regime for results:
        "fl"  : sort by filepath, then line number [default]
        "fa"  : sort by filepath, then alphabetically by line text
        "a"   : sort alphabetically by line text

g:buffersaurus_move_wrap~
    Default: 1
    If true [default], then result navigation wraps (i.e., moving to a "next"
    result when already on the last result goes to the first result, while
    moving to a "previous" result when already on the first result goes to the
    last result). If false, then result navigation does not wrap.

g:buffersaurus_set_search_register~
    Default: 1
    If true [default], then ":Bsgrep {pattern}" assigns {pattern} to the
    search register.

g:buffersaurus_show_context~
    Default: 0
    If false, then show uncontexted lines by default; otherwise, show
    contexted lines.

g:buffersaurus_context_size~
    Default: [4, 4]
    Must be a two-element list value. Determines the number of lines to show
    before and after matching indexed lines in results. First element gives
    the number of lines of context to show before matching line, while second
    elements gives the number of lines of context to show after the matching
    line.
